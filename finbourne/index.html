			<p>At University, I studied a Masters in Structural Engineering with focus on algorithmic design. 
			I always had an interest in technology and spent my University days working with Matlab for research, and 
			C# for side projects - mostly video games for android devices</p>
			<p>In my final year, I decided to take on a thesis subject that allowed me have fun with programming. 
			Together with an industry partner, we agreed on a thesis theme that allowed me to do just that. 
			I developed a bespoke genetic algorithm capable of designing steel structures faster and better than a human engineer. </p>
			
			<p>This was a great opportunity to get some full-time experience programming and allowed me to learn more about C#.
			At the end of this page you will find a link with work samples where this code is included.</p>
			
			<p>Be advised that the code quality is laughable, at the time
			 I was learning C# and have since improved in my latest projects - and look forward improving
			  further and become a coding wizard under the guidance of your engineers!</p>

        <div class="about-text">
			<p>After University, I started work in Portugal as a normal structural engineer, but it didn't take much time for me to realise that 
			I missed the technology side of things. 
			I soon accepted an offer from a company in London known for mixing structural engineering work with programming, in a field called Computational Design.</p>
			<p>Things have been going well at the company, I've had the opportunity to work with various technologies (D3.js, Docker, Azure, C#, and others) 
			and was even able to develop and deploy to production some deep learning and reinforcement learning models to help with finite element analysis!</p>
			<p>I was also fortunate to join when my team had just won an internal accelerator programme (like Dragons' Den but only ideas from employees compete for funding). 
			This effectively gave us authorization from management to act as a separate entity to the main company in order to push our winning product to market.</p>
			<p>This meant we operated a lot less like a construction company and more like a tech startup. 
			The fast work pace was thrilling and the experience allowed me to learn more about agile methodologies, git, 
			massively improve C# skills, gain some experience in cloud computing and gain insight in what it takes to build and launch a SaaS product.</p>

			<p>However, being in a structural design company meant I still had to spend half my time doing traditional structural engineering work. 
			This became harder to be enthusiastic about because I was having way more fun on the software development side of things and this only compounded every time 
			I learned a new technology.</p>
			<p>It started to become obvious that I needed to make a transition into a tech focused role so I started working towards that.</p>

			<p>From my experience, I knew that the best way to learn new things was to get hands-on practice, so I 
			started to think of a side project that could act as a good portfolio project and, at the same time, allow me to gain experience in
			 the areas that interested me the most:</p>
			<p>These included learning more about serverless architectures and cloud computing, gain some skills in frontend web development and finally ,
			 incrase my knowledge in some areas of machine learning of particular interest to me such as time series data analysis and NLP.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
			<p>Once I had defined these key skills I wanted to develop, it became easy to think of a project to develop. Ever since I read Graham's "The Intelligent Investor",
			my interest in finance has been growing. In fact, one of my pastimes of the last few years has been making my own stock analysis. 
			<br/>
			Currently the analysis are mostly in excel spreadsheets but I always thought it would be
			cool to create a dashboard that could run my favourite analysis on any stock with little manual interaction. 
			</p>
			<p>This is exactly what my project has become, a serverless web app with various analysis modules that outputs analysis results for any given stock searched by the user.
			</p>
			<p>It is under development (see link at the end for source code) and it has the following technical characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>-For the frontend I'm using Blazor, a new framework from .Net Core 3.0 that uses webassembly to allow C# to run on the browser;</li>
			<li><br/></li>
			<li>-For the backend, I'm using a standard serverless architecture with an API management service to handle requests and authentication, cloud functions to feed data back to the frontend and a few SQL DBs for user data;</li>
			<br/>
			<li>-To allow me to gain experience in NLP, the app will also have a special analysis module that collects headlines from the google news API and posts from twitter for a given stock and will run a sentiment analysis classification.</li>

        <div class="about-text">
			<p>This stock dashboard project is still in development - and I have to admit I was not expecting to apply for tech companies so early on in my conversion journey
			 from structural to software engineering - but the opportunity at Finbourne was just too good to miss.</p>
			<p>When I saw the job post on the side bar of stackoverflow, I could not ignore the clear subject overlap of my 
			stock dashboard web app and Finbourne's LUSID platform. Applying was a no brainer since I would be working full time on what effectively is now my hobby.</p>
			<p>Adding to this, I'm well aware of how much management fees can eat into profits over the years and with LUSID,
			 I understand the positive impact that you can have on people's savings over time by reducing operational costs for asset managers.
			  I find it incredibly exciting to have the 
			opportunity to rebuild from the ground up, systems in which the entire asset management sector relies upon!</p>
			
			<p>Hopefully this has explained a bit better why a structural engineer is applying for a software engineering role and why I'm exited to be part of the team!</p>
			
			<p>I've also included some code samples from some of my projects in the button below.
			Apologies in advance for the code quality of the Genetic Algorithm, as you will see, it is clear that I was self taught in C# and hopefully you will see how I progressed to write better quality code by looking at the other projects.</p>
